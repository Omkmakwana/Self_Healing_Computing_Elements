## Synaptic Resilience Architecture (SRA) — Proposed Solution

**Idea Title:** Synaptic Resilience Architecture (SRA)

**Concept:** FPGA-based platform that **predicts** and **prevents** failures using distributed on-chip AI and partial reconfiguration (PR).

**Core Mechanics:**
- Each critical logic block paired with a lightweight AI "Guardian Module".
- Guardians ingest real-time telemetry: temperature, voltage, timing margins, soft error counters.
- Predictive anomaly detection flags impending degradation (vs post-failure reaction).
- On prediction + confirmation, the system **autonomously reroutes** workload to a spare region via PR with zero downtime.

**How It Solves the Problem:**
- Autonomous, real-time detection + bypass of hardware faults.
- No manual intervention; continuous mission operation.

**Innovation & Uniqueness:**
- Shift from reactive to proactive self-healing.
- Distributed TinyML per-block, not centralized monitoring.
- Two-tier decision (AI + BIST) reduces false positives.

## Technical Approach

**Technologies:**
- Hardware: FPGA (Xilinx/Intel) w/ Partial Reconfiguration, Microcontroller / Soft-core CPU, On-chip sensors.
- HDL: Verilog / VHDL for logic + Guardian Modules.
- Firmware: C/C++ for System Health Manager.
- ML: Python + TensorFlow Lite (TinyML inference models).

**Process Flow:**
1. Monitor – Guardians stream metrics.
2. Predict – TinyML model raises anomaly.
3. Alert – Guardian notifies System Health Manager (SHM).
4. Isolate & Activate – SHM freezes suspect block; allocates spare.
5. Reconfigure & Reroute – Partial bitstream loaded; data paths switched.
6. Continue Mission – Operation uninterrupted.

## Feasibility & Viability

**Technological Feasibility:**
- Modern FPGAs support partial reconfiguration + embedded soft processors.
- TinyML models (few kB) fit easily in block RAM / LUT budget.

**Implementation Feasibility:**
- Modular architecture (Guardian + SHM) enables incremental bring-up.

**Risks:**
- False positives causing unnecessary swaps.
- Resource overhead from AI inference.

**Mitigations:**
- 2-step verification (AI anomaly -> fast BIST confirmation).
- Optimized feature extraction + sparse inference schedule.

## Impact & Benefits

**Target Impact:** Defence systems: satellites, autonomous drones, radar, secure communication nodes.

**Benefits:**
- Strategic: Enhances resilience & mission assurance.
- Economic: Extends hardware lifespan; lowers maintenance & replacement cycles.
- Operational: Near-zero downtime through predictive failover.

**Alignment:** Directly fulfills goal of surviving and bypassing faults gracefully.
