## 1. Introduction  
Modern defence and aerospace systems demand **uninterrupted operation** in extreme environments where manual repair is impossible. Satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), radar systems, and autonomous defence platforms must continue functioning even when hardware faults occur due to **radiation, thermal stress, aging, or manufacturing defects**. Traditional fault-tolerant designs rely on redundancy (e.g., Triple Modular Redundancy, TMR) or reactive recovery (reset, reboot, or manual intervention). However, these approaches are **reactive, resource-intensive, and limited in scalability**.  

The emerging paradigm of **self-healing computing elements** introduces **autonomous, predictive, and adaptive fault management**. Instead of waiting for a failure, the system anticipates it, isolates the vulnerable component, and reconfigures itself in real time. This research explores the **Synaptic Resilience Architecture (SRA)** â€” an FPGA-based framework that integrates **AI-driven anomaly detection, Built-In Self-Test (BIST), and partial reconfiguration** to achieve proactive self-healing.

## 2. Background and Motivation  

### 2.1 Faults in Defence Electronics  
- **Transient faults**: Caused by radiation (Single Event Upsets, SEUs) in space or high-altitude environments.  
- **Permanent faults**: Due to aging, electromigration, or thermal stress.  
- **Intermittent faults**: Sporadic failures caused by unstable interconnects or marginal timing.  

In defence systems, even a **single undetected fault** can compromise mission success. For example:  
- A satellite communication module failing mid-orbit cannot be repaired.  
- A UAV radar processor glitch could lead to mission failure.  
- A missile guidance system fault could cause catastrophic consequences.  

### 2.2 Limitations of Traditional Approaches  
- **Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR):** Triplicates hardware and uses majority voting. Effective but **area- and power-hungry**.  
- **Error Correction Codes (ECC):** Useful for memory but limited for logic blocks.  
- **Watchdog timers & resets:** Reactive, causing downtime.  

Thus, there is a need for **lightweight, predictive, and adaptive fault tolerance**.

## 3. Proposed Solution: Synaptic Resilience Architecture (SRA)  

The **SRA framework** is inspired by biological systems where neurons reroute signals around damaged pathways.  

### 3.1 Core Components  
1. **Guardian Modules (Distributed AI Monitors):**  
   - Each FPGA logic block is paired with a Guardian.  
   - Collects telemetry: temperature, voltage, timing delays, switching activity.  
   - Runs a **TinyML anomaly detection model** to predict faults.  

2. **System Health Manager (Central Coordinator):**  
   - Receives alerts from Guardians.  
   - Confirms anomalies via **Built-In Self-Test (BIST)**.  
   - Decides whether to isolate and reroute.  

3. **Partial Reconfiguration Engine:**  
   - Dynamically reprograms FPGA regions.  
   - Loads spare logic blocks with required functionality.  
   - Ensures **zero downtime** during switchover.  

### 3.2 Healing Workflow  
1. **Monitor:** Guardians continuously track block health.  
2. **Predict:** AI flags anomalies (e.g., abnormal thermal drift).  
3. **Verify:** BIST confirms fault likelihood.  
4. **Isolate:** Faulty block is quarantined.  
5. **Reconfigure:** Spare block is programmed via partial reconfiguration.  
6. **Reroute:** Data paths are redirected seamlessly.  
7. **Continue Mission:** System operates without interruption.

## 4. Technical Foundations  

### 4.1 FPGA Partial Reconfiguration  
- **Xilinx Dynamic Function eXchange (DFX)** and **Intel PR** allow reprogramming of FPGA regions while the rest of the device continues running.  
- Enables **hot-swapping faulty modules** without halting the system.  
- Research shows PR can reduce downtime from seconds to **microseconds**.  

### 4.2 Built-In Self-Test (BIST)  
- BIST injects test patterns and analyzes responses to detect stuck-at, bridging, or timing faults.  
- Modern BIST can be integrated with FPGA Configurable Logic Blocks (CLBs) without significant area overhead [Mahesh Kumar, 2019].  
- In SRA, BIST acts as a **verification layer** to reduce false positives from AI predictions.  

### 4.3 TinyML for Predictive Healing  
- **TinyML** enables running ML models on microcontrollers and FPGA soft cores.  
- Techniques:  
  - **Autoencoders** for anomaly detection.  
  - **Decision Trees / Random Forests** for classification of fault signatures.  
  - **Lightweight CNNs** for thermal/power pattern recognition.  
- TensorFlow Lite Micro allows models <50KB to run on embedded systems.  

### 4.4 Redundancy Strategy  
- Instead of full TMR, SRA uses **selective redundancy**:  
  - Only critical modules have spares.  
  - Spares remain unpowered until needed, saving energy.

## 5. Feasibility and Challenges  

### 5.1 Feasibility  
- **Technology readiness:** Modern FPGAs (Xilinx Ultrascale+, Intel Stratix 10) support PR and embedded AI.  
- **Scalability:** Modular Guardian design allows incremental deployment.  
- **Defence alignment:** Meets requirements of **autonomy, resilience, and survivability**.  

### 5.2 Challenges  
1. **False Positives:** AI may misclassify normal fluctuations as faults.  
   - Mitigation: AI + BIST hybrid verification.  
2. **Overhead:** Monitoring and AI inference consume resources.  
   - Mitigation: TinyML compression, quantization, and pruning.  
3. **Radiation Effects:** PR bitstreams themselves may be corrupted.  
   - Mitigation: Use **scrubbing** and **error-correcting configuration memory**.  
4. **Latency:** Switching must be seamless.  
   - Mitigation: Pre-load spare blocks in standby mode.
